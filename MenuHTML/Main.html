            <h4>
                The Konoha Academy is meant for the development as shinobi with respect to individuality.
                In a free, open-minded environment students are allowed to stengthen their bodies and minds, discovering their own ninja paths.
                When they have found their way, they are guided by the belief that fills them.
                Children undertake an entrance exam which tests whether they have any aptitude for the ninja arts,
                whether they are healthy in body and mind, possess a spirit able to endure hard work and training,
                and a love for their village with the hope to help preserve peace and prosperity.
                Students are given basic training and education so they gain sturdy bodies and fundamental knowledge immediately after entrance.
                They learn the type of things that all children are expected to learn but the focus of their lessons is always on their role as shinobi in training.
